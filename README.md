## Repository management

**/testing**: for now, all code goes in here, in a relevant folder  
**/modules**: when a module (e.g. an integrator) is completely finished and appropriately packaged, it goes in here  
**/.vscode, /.ipynb_checkpoints**: don't touch these

- **Create a new branch for whatever you're working on.**
